# 🚀 Nave OnLine

**Nave OnLine** is an arcade-style game developed in **Python** using **Tkinter**.  
The player controls a spaceship using **WASD** keys, navigating through space to capture planets and progress through levels.

Each level increases the challenge — planets grow larger and move faster.  
In the final stage, a **meteor shower** appears, where the main goal is not to conquer, but to **survive** as long as possible.

🕹️ **Key Features**
- Built entirely with Python and Tkinter  
- Smooth WASD controls for ship movement  
- Progressive difficulty with dynamic planet scaling  
- Final survival stage with a meteor shower challenge  

✨ A simple yet engaging project showcasing Python’s graphical capabilities and game logic.
